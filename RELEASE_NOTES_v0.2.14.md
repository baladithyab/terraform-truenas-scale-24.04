# Release Notes - v0.2.14

**Release Date:** 2025-10-31

## üéØ Boot Order Control

This release adds the ability to control the boot order of VM devices, fixing a critical bug where devices always booted in a fixed order (NICs ‚Üí Disks ‚Üí CDROMs) regardless of user configuration.

---

## üêõ The Bug That Was Fixed

### Before v0.2.14 (BROKEN)

The provider was creating devices with hardcoded boot order based on device **type**:
- **NICs** always got order 1000, 1001, 1002...
- **Disks** always got order 1003, 1004, 1005...
- **CDROMs** always got order 1006, 1007, 1008...

This meant:
- ‚ùå **Disks ALWAYS booted before CDROMs** - impossible to install OS from ISO
- ‚ùå **No way to control boot priority** - users couldn't specify boot order
- ‚ùå **Talos Linux installations failed** - needed to boot from ISO first

### After v0.2.14 (FIXED)

Users can now specify the `order` attribute for each device:
- ‚úÖ **Lower order boots first** - full control over boot sequence
- ‚úÖ **Install OS from ISO** - set CDROM order=1, Disk order=2
- ‚úÖ **Talos Linux works** - boot from ISO for install, disk for operation
- ‚úÖ **Backward compatible** - if order not specified, uses auto-incrementing (1000+)

---

## ‚ú® What's New

### Boot Order Attribute

All device types now support the `order` attribute:

```hcl
nic_devices = [{
  type       = "VIRTIO"
  nic_attach = "eno1"
  order      = 1003  # Optional: boot order
}]

disk_devices = [{
  path  = "/dev/zvol/pool/vms/disk0"
  type  = "VIRTIO"
  order = 1  # Lower order = boots FIRST
}]

cdrom_devices = [{
  path  = "/mnt/pool/isos/ubuntu.iso"
  order = 2  # Higher order = boots SECOND
}]
```

### How It Works

The `order` field maps directly to libvirt's `<boot order='X'/>` attribute in the VM's XML configuration. This controls which device the BIOS/UEFI firmware tries to boot from first.

**Lower order value = Higher boot priority**

---

## üìñ Common Use Cases

### 1. Install OS from ISO

Boot from CDROM first to install OS, then from disk:

```hcl
resource "truenas_vm" "install_ubuntu" {
  name   = "ubuntu"
  memory = 4096
  vcpus  = 2

  # CDROM boots FIRST (order 1)
  cdrom_devices = [{
    path  = "/mnt/pool/isos/ubuntu-22.04.iso"
    order = 1
  }]

  # Disk boots SECOND (order 2)
  disk_devices = [{
    path  = "/dev/zvol/pool/vms/ubuntu-disk0"
    type  = "VIRTIO"
    order = 2
  }]

  nic_devices = [{
    type       = "VIRTIO"
    nic_attach = "eno1"
  }]

  bootloader = "UEFI"
}
```

**Boot sequence:**
1. VM boots from Ubuntu ISO
2. Install Ubuntu to disk
3. After installation, disk has bootloader and takes over
4. ISO remains attached but boots second

### 2. Normal Operation (Boot from Disk)

After OS is installed, boot from disk first:

```hcl
resource "truenas_vm" "production" {
  name   = "production"
  memory = 8192
  vcpus  = 4

  # Disk boots FIRST (order 1)
  disk_devices = [{
    path  = "/dev/zvol/pool/vms/prod-disk0"
    type  = "VIRTIO"
    order = 1
  }]

  # CDROM boots SECOND (fallback/rescue)
  cdrom_devices = [{
    path  = "/mnt/pool/isos/rescue.iso"
    order = 2
  }]

  nic_devices = [{
    type       = "VIRTIO"
    nic_attach = "eno1"
  }]

  bootloader = "UEFI"
}
```

### 3. Talos Linux Worker Node

Boot from Talos ISO for installation, then from disk:

```hcl
resource "truenas_vm" "talos_worker" {
  name   = "talosworker01"
  memory = 8192
  vcpus  = 4

  nic_devices = [{
    type       = "VIRTIO"
    nic_attach = "eno1"
  }]

  # Boot from Talos ISO FIRST for installation
  cdrom_devices = [{
    path  = "/mnt/pool/isos/talos-v1.10.6-metal-amd64.iso"
    order = 1  # Boots FIRST
  }]

  # Boot from disk SECOND (after Talos is installed)
  disk_devices = [{
    path   = "/dev/zvol/pool/vms/talos-worker-01-disk0"
    type   = "VIRTIO"
    iotype = "THREADS"
    order  = 2  # Boots SECOND
  }]

  bootloader      = "UEFI"
  start_on_create = true
}
```

**Talos installation process:**
1. VM boots from Talos ISO (order 1)
2. Talos installs to disk
3. After installation, Talos on disk takes over
4. ISO remains attached but boots second (order 2)

### 4. Multi-Disk System

Specify boot priority for multiple disks:

```hcl
resource "truenas_vm" "multi_disk" {
  name   = "multidisk"
  memory = 16384
  vcpus  = 8

  # Primary OS disk boots FIRST
  disk_devices = [
    {
      path  = "/dev/zvol/pool/vms/os-disk"
      type  = "VIRTIO"
      order = 1  # Primary boot disk
    },
    {
      path  = "/dev/zvol/pool/vms/data-disk"
      type  = "VIRTIO"
      order = 3  # Data disk (not bootable)
    }
  ]

  # Rescue ISO as fallback
  cdrom_devices = [{
    path  = "/mnt/pool/isos/rescue.iso"
    order = 2  # Boot if primary disk fails
  }]

  nic_devices = [{
    type       = "VIRTIO"
    nic_attach = "eno1"
  }]

  bootloader = "UEFI"
}
```

---

## üîÑ Default Behavior (Backward Compatible)

If you **don't specify** the `order` attribute, devices are assigned auto-incrementing orders starting at 1000:

```hcl
resource "truenas_vm" "default" {
  name = "myvm"

  nic_devices = [{
    nic_attach = "eno1"
    # order = 1000 (auto-assigned)
  }]

  disk_devices = [{
    path = "/dev/zvol/pool/vms/disk0"
    # order = 1001 (auto-assigned)
  }]

  cdrom_devices = [{
    path = "/mnt/pool/isos/ubuntu.iso"
    # order = 1002 (auto-assigned)
  }]
}
```

**Result:** Devices are ordered in the sequence they appear in your config.

## üîß Migration Guide

### Existing VMs (No Changes Needed)

If you have existing VMs created with v0.2.13 or earlier:
- ‚úÖ **No action required** - they will continue to work
- ‚úÖ **Order is auto-assigned** - devices keep their current order
- ‚úÖ **Backward compatible** - no breaking changes

### Adding Boot Order to Existing VMs

To add explicit boot order to existing VMs:

1. **Add `order` attribute to your Terraform config:**
   ```hcl
   disk_devices = [{
     path  = "/dev/zvol/pool/vms/disk0"
     type  = "VIRTIO"
     order = 1  # Add this line
   }]

   cdrom_devices = [{
     path  = "/mnt/pool/isos/ubuntu.iso"
     order = 2  # Add this line
   }]
   ```

2. **Apply the changes:**
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

3. **Restart the VM** (if needed):
   - Changes may require VM restart to take effect
   - Check TrueNAS UI to verify boot order

---

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Fixed: Boot Order Not Respected

**Issue:** Devices were always created with hardcoded order based on type (NICs ‚Üí Disks ‚Üí CDROMs), ignoring any user-specified order.

**Root Cause:** The `createDevices()` function used a hardcoded `deviceOrder` variable that incremented for each device, regardless of user configuration.

**Fix:** 
- Added `order` field to all device models (NICDeviceModel, DiskDeviceModel, CDROMDeviceModel)
- Updated schema to include `order` attribute for all device types
- Modified `createDevices()` to use user-specified order if provided
- Updated `readVM()` to read order from API and populate in state

**Impact:** Users can now control boot order, enabling OS installation from ISO and proper Talos Linux deployments.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

1. **VM Names:** Must be alphanumeric only (no hyphens, underscores, or special characters)
2. **Device Updates:** Changing boot order may require VM restart
3. **Unique Orders:** Each device should have a unique order value (undefined behavior if duplicates)
